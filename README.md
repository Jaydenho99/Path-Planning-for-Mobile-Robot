# Path-Planning-for-Mobile-Robot
Path Planning for Mobile Robot with Object Recognition for Obstacle Avoidance Purposes using Coppeliasim and Matlab

A navigation system for a mobile robot in solving a static and dynamic path planning problem is implemented using an image segmentation technique as object recognition to detect the obstacles in the environment. Then, the mobile robot uses the information to avoid obstacles and generate a random path for the robot to navigate from its starting point to its goal. Besides that, Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) technique is also implemented in
the robot to determine the location of the robot and to draw a map of the environment.
